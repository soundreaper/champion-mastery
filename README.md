This is a Flask web application that uses Riot Games API. The user should input their
League of Legends in-game username and the application will return some basic statistics
such as your rank and winrate and then it will display your top 5 champion masteries!

The motivation behind this project was that I couldn't find an easy way to view simple statistics
and see my champion mastery points in the same place. There was only one or the other on all the
other web applications I found.
